                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>Swimming</strong> -
						 sport or sports discipline, which consists in overcoming 
						 swim in the shortest time of different distances.
                </p>
				 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDrawings on archaeological finds show,
				 that people in Ancient Egypt, Assyria, Phoenicia and many other countries were able to swim 
				 for several millennia before our era, and known them ways the passage reminded 
				 the modern front crawl and breaststroke. At that time, swimming was purely applied — 
				 when fishing, hunting for waterfowl, underwater fishing, in military Affairs.
				 In Ancient Greece, swimming was used as an important means of physical education.</p>

						<h2>Types of swimming</h2> 
						<h3>Freestyle</h3>
						 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>Freestyle</strong>
						 - discipline of swimming, in which the swimmer is allowed to swim by any means, arbitrarily
						 changing them during the distance. Currently, all swimmers use the rabbit.
						 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
						 During the development of swimming the following styles were used:</p>
						 <p>
						 <li>Breaststroke. Brass technique was first analyzed by the Dane Nicholas Winman 
						 in a book published in 1538; for several centuries 
						 brass took the lead in all swimming schools.</li><br><br>
						 <li>Over-arm (persistent. overarm stroke) - improved by the British in the middle of XIX 
						 century the popular method of swimming on the side.</li><br><br>
						 <li>Trajan-style —
						 style of swimming, which was first demonstrated in 1873 by the Englishman John Arthur Trejen.
						 Gradually, Trajan-style replaced the breaststroke and the over arm. At long distances, the trejen style was used in major competitions in the 1920s; 
						 the last Olympic champion and world record holder to use the trejen style was canadian George Hodgson, who won the
						 1912 games in swimming at 400 m and 1500 m with world records.</li><br><br>
						 <li>The crawl was first demonstrated by Australian Richmond Cavill; the first major victories with 
						 the use of the crawl was won by the Hungarian Zoltan Halmay and American Charles Daniels, 
						 winning at the Games of 1904 2 of the race. Thanks to improvements, 
						 you made us swim, crawl to the end of the 1920s years, finally
						 supplanted other styles.</li></p><img src="pl2.jpg" height="350" width="600"><br><br>
						<h3>Backstroke</h3>
							<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBack swimming for the first time 
							it was included as an independent species at the 1900 Olympic games. 
							In the early years, swimmers used an inverted breaststroke. The first major
							success in swimming crawl on his back made the American Harry Hebner, who won 
							at the Olympic games of 1912; then, in the backstroke, the freestyle quickly 
							replaced brass.<br><br>

				 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStart in swimming on the back is made of water: 
				 a sportsman to face the bedside table, holding with both hands starting handrails, 
				 feet resting against the side of the pool. Excluding the moment of turning, the athlete 
				 should float on the back; " normal back position may include rotational 
				 movement of the body in the horizontal plane up to 90° inclusive; the position of the head is not
				 regulates.» The athlete can be completely submerged in water only "during 
				 turn, at the finish and at a distance of not more than 15 m after the start and each turn".</p>

			   <h3>Brass, butterfly</h3>
			   <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
						 Swimming breaststroke became an independent type of program at the Olympic games in 1904.
						 In the mid-1930s in the US and (later) in the USSR
						 there is a new, faster variety of brass 
						 - butterfly, who replaced the classic brass. Since 1953 
						 						 year the FINALS have identified the butterfly as its own discipline 
						 (in the USSR, such a division occurred in 1949).</p>
