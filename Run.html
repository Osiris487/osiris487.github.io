                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>Run</strong> - one way to get around 
				(locomotion) of humans and animals; characterized by the presence of the so-called "flight phase" and 
				it is carried out as a result of complex coordinated activity of skeletal muscles and
				limbs'. For running is characterized, in General, the same cycle of movements as when walking,
				the same acting forces and functional muscle groups. The difference between running and walking is
				the lack of the running phase of double support.
                </p><br><img src="b1.jpg" height="400" width="600">
				 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRunning provides a good environment as
				 aerobic exercise, which increases the threshold of endurance, has a positive effect
				 on the cardiovascular system, increases metabolism in the body and thus,
				 helps to exercise control over body weight. Running has a positive effect on the immune system 
				 system and improves skin tone.</p>
				 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRunning allows you to adjust the rhythmic work 
				 endocrine and nervous systems. During the run, when a person is constantly overcome 
				 the earth's gravity, jumping and falling in an upright position, the blood flow in 
				 the vessel is in resonance with running, while aktiviziruyutsya previously untapped
				 capillaries. Microcirculation of blood activates the activity of the organs of internal secretion.
				 The flow of hormones increases and contributes to the coordination of the activities of other organs and 
				 body system.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMostly running. 
				  the muscles of the heart, thigh and Shin are involved, and the legs are not the same
				  nodes of the same muscles that many athletes try to load in the gym, 
				  replacing run. In the Shin when running, not only the calf muscle is involved, 
				  which can develop when walking on heels. Foot pushes also 
				  flexor and extensor of the thumb and middle finger, develops flounder
				  and the anterior tibial muscle. From that, the Shin becomes more smooth or 
				  full, harmoniously developed.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSecondary development of muscles receives the rectus abdominis. 
But the development of breath develops and costal sites in this muscle.</p>
				 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBreathing when running is based on the need
				 the body of oxygen. Oxygen starvation causes increased heart rate, 
				 that affects the shortness of breath. Breathing, in which the runner is easy to talk,
				 aerobic is called, is considered the heartbeat of less than 60% relative to the maximum 
				 possible. Breathing in which hard to speak, called respiration with oxygen 
				 hunger. Artificially created oxygen starvation causes the muscles to work harder, 
				 to increase the number of microcapillaries, develops in the lungs an increased number of
				 blood vessels that from less air allows oxygen to be taken away 
				 quality.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEngaged in running on an empty stomach, 
				  planning nutrition in such a way that by the beginning of training the stomach was empty. 
				  A full stomach strains the pancreas, can contribute to the appearance of pain 
				  in his side.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRunning and running competitions are known in 
				  history of man "reasonable" at all times, on all continents, 
				  of all the Nations, beginning from a person "skillful". It's those physical exercises. 
				  which were necessary for the girls of ancient Greece, for the birth of healthy 
				  children's. (Aristotle wrote about this, criticizing the legislation that does not oblige 
				  parents play sports with girls)</p>
